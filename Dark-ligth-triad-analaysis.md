## Introduction

This analysis explores the poem "I Want to Travel Again" (میخوام دوباره سفر کنم) through multiple psychological lenses, including defense mechanisms and personality models.

## Defense Mechanisms in the Poem

| Level of Maturity | Defense Mechanism | Example from the Poem |

## Personality Model Analysis

### Dark Triad Perspective

1. **Narcissism**: The desire for extreme isolation could be seen as a form of grandiose fantasy.
2. **Machiavellianism**: The rejection of societal structures might indicate a manipulative attitude towards social norms.
3. **Psychopathy**: The lack of empathy for others' emotions and societal needs is evident in the desire for complete isolation.

### Light Triad Perspective

1. **Faith in Humanity**: The poem shows a lack of faith in humanity, contrasting with this light triad trait.
2. **Humanism**: There's a connection with nature and animals, showing a form of respect for living beings.
3. **Kantianism**: The desire for authenticity aligns with treating people as ends in themselves, not means.

### Alternative Light Triad (Sacrifice, Cooperation, Love)

1. **Sacrifice**: The narrator sacrifices societal comforts for personal authenticity.
2. **Cooperation**: Limited evidence of cooperation, mostly with nature and animals.
3. **Love**: Love is expressed for nature and simplicity, but not for human connections.

## Comparative Analysis

When comparing these models:

1. The defense mechanisms reveal a complex psychological state, with a mix of mature and immature coping strategies.
2. The dark triad perspective highlights potential narcissistic and antisocial tendencies in the extreme desire for isolation.
3. The light triad view shows some alignment with humanism and authenticity, but a lack of faith in humanity.
4. The alternative light triad reveals a form of sacrifice for personal growth, but limited cooperation and a redefined concept of love focused on nature rather than people.

## Conclusion

This multi-faceted analysis demonstrates how a single piece of art can be interpreted through various psychological models, each offering unique insights. The poem reveals a complex interplay of defense mechanisms and personality traits, reflecting the narrator's struggle with societal disillusionment and the search for authentic existence.

The contrast between the dark and light triad perspectives highlights the ambiguity in the narrator's motivations. While there are elements that could be interpreted as narcissistic or antisocial, there's also a genuine search for meaning and connection with nature that aligns with more positive personality traits.

This approach to analysis allows for a richer understanding of the psychological depth within the poem, showcasing how different models can provide complementary insights into human psychology and artistic expression.
